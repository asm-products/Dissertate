# Wits University thesis LaTeX template

This package provides all the files needed to support the production and typesetting of a PhD dissertation at the [University of the Witwatersrand](http://www.wits.ac.za/) (Johannesburg, South Africa). The format and styling is based closely on the requirements published by the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment.
  
This package is a customised version of the fanastic [Dissertate](https://github.com/suchow/Dissertate) LaTeX templates created by [Jordan Suchow](https://github.com/suchow). Only minimal changes were made to fit the Wits University style guide.
